> I realized then that even though I was a tiny speck in an infinite cosmos, a blip on the timeline of eternity, I was not without purpose. - R.J. Anderson

Once the idea popped into my head, it made all the sense in the world. I'm not sure where the inspiration came from or why it decided to show up when it did, but as I was laying in bed one night, thinking of where my life was going, I got an idea. I was going to learn how to code and become a Software Engineer.

The diagram above does a pretty good job of illustrating the internal stuggle in my brain when trying to think through career paths. Do I do something I love? Do I focus on something the world need? Do I just work to make money? Do I do something because I can, even if I don't love it? Welcome to my mind. Sorry it's such a mess! 

I've never really been able to find something that balances each area of venn diagram. The past two years, I've been working as an administrative assistant at a Christian non-profit organization in Philadelphia. That does a pretty good job at meeting a need in the world and I'm pretty good at it, but I don't love the work itself and it definitely doesn't pay the bills.

When Software Engineering randomly popped into my mind, I decided to try it out. I began to learn basic coding wherever I could online for free.  I tried a few tutorials and as I practiced and found solutions to problems, I realized I was **thoroughly enjoying** the challenge. The world also **needs** coders. We live in a society that is completely relient on technology, yet so few people have the skills to really utilize it for all that it can do. And because the people with these vital skills are few and far between, **the industry pays**! The stats are pretty exciting for someone who has been getting paid a non-profit salary the last two years.

The only part of the venn diagram I'm not sure about is whether I am good at it. That is yet to be determined and the minute I started researching the possibility of becoming a Software Engineering, the insecurities started shouting loud and clear: 

* Am I really smart enough to be a Software Engineer?
* What would my family and friends say if I told them? 
* Would I actually be able to land a job, even if I could learn how to code? 
* Would I be taken seriously?
* Would I be able to make a difference in the world? 
* Am I really that nerdy?

Could I actually become a Software Engineer? 

Let's find out! In complete leap-of-faith style, I decided to try. I decided to drown out the insecurities and see what I can do. I'm stepping into discomfort and uncertainty and I'm trusting that I'll land on my feet. 

For anyone who stumbles upon this blog hoping to find some kind of guarantee that you'll suceed in the field, you won't find it here. What you'll find instead is an ordinary girl, trying something new and if I can do it, you can, too.
